# maximal-frequent-itemset-mining
Given a transaction database and a minimum support count(minsup), if the itemset's support in the transaction database is >= minsup, and its length is maximal, then the itemset is a maximal frequent itemset

with minsup = 2, maximal frequent itemset = ABDE, BCDE
with minsup = 4, maximal frequent itemset = c, BDE
